Today, we are happy to announce RInno's first minor release. Over the past 6 months, RInno has been downloaded over [1200](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/RInno) times, and there are data scientists using it at the FDIC, the US Treasury and US Department of Agriculture among other large organizations. We have been getting weekly questions from the community about its features, and we even received our first question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45700435/5490949). The most exciting development, however, is what led to this minor release.

Hanjo Odendaal, a PhD student and data science consultant from South Africa, came to us with a question about how to install RStudio's newest dashboarding package, [flexdashboard](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/). He had a fully formed idea about how he thought it should work, so I asked him if he'd like to team up and implement it together. Over the past few months, he has been an incredibly thoughtful contributor to the project and really made some solid contributions to this release.

At the same time, many of the issues people submitted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ficonsulting/RInno/issues) were related to app start up instability problems. Therefore, this release includes stability improvements, which are a combination of registry queries and improvements to the Inno Setup Scripts produced by RInno. That information allows Data Scientists to focus on their work instead of fixing broken paths on various desktop configurations and administering their apps. 

Our next release will most likely include support for OAuth2 for advanced implementations that utilize RInno's [continuous installation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RInno/vignettes/cont-installation.html) methodology, but feel free add your thoughts in the comments section below or the issues section of GitHub. We would love to hear from you.

## Minimal Example

{% highlight r %}
# Create an example flexdashboard in the "app" directory
example_app(
	app_dir = "app", 
	type = "flexdashboard")
	
# Build an RInno installation framework
create_app(
	app_name = "myapp", 
	app_dir = "app", 
	include_Pandoc = TRUE) # See Pandoc Dependency section for details
	
# Compile the installer with Inno Setup
compile_iss()
{% endhighlight %}

## Flexdashboards
Dubbed "easy interactive dashboards for R" by RStudio, flexdashboards are a hybrid between shiny apps and rmarkdown. You get the interactivity of a web application, with the statistical and data visualization power of R, managed via the simplicity of an rmarkdown document. Flexdashboards are an extremely powerful data science tool. RStudio, at this year's RStudio DevCon, said that their long-term goal is to  make them stand-alone html, css and javascript apps without an R server. This would make it possible to open them in a browser and expand their audience in many business settings. I am incredibly excited about this project and we will continue to look for ways to support it through RInno.

This NBA Scoring flexdashboard is a great example of the simplicity and power of these new applications. It includes a D3 JavaScript visualization and stat table and only requires 29 lines of rmarkdown code:

You can see why the first thing Hanjo asked about RInno was: "Can I use flexdashboards?" Well, thanks to him, now you can.

### Flexdashboard Check
When `create_app` is called, RInno now runs Hanjo's `flexdashboard_check` to determine if your app is a flexdashboard. If it is, then `flexdashboard` and `rmarkdown` are added to your app's R package dependency list and RInno prints a message to the R console to communicate its findings.

This flexdashboard will be used:
 - example.Rmd

### Pandoc Dependency
As many of you probably know, rmarkdown uses a universal document conversion tool called Pandoc to convert rmarkdown documents into pdf, html and Microsoft Word documents among other things. We decided to handle the Pandoc dependency like R itself. There are two arguments to manage it. The first, `include_Pandoc`, is a boolean argument that tells RInno to include Pandoc in your app's installation. The second, `Pandoc_version`, is the version of Pandoc to include. It defaults to the version of Pandoc used by the rmarkdown package in order to ensure that it is the same version of Pandoc used to develop the dashboard, but you can give it other versions if you want.

Similar to the way that RInno handles R, it only installs Pandoc if a computer does not have a registry entry for Pandoc. Once the installation is complete, RInno queries the registry for Pandoc's installation path and uses it to kick off the flexdashboard. Keep in mind, this is not a version specific check because Pandoc does not have version information in its registry entry. One big difference between the Pandoc check and the R check is that if users have a different version of Pandoc installed on their computers, this check will find it, regardless of its version, and not include the version of Pandoc included with the RInno installer. We may have to release some patches to handle this differently at some point in the near future.

## The Registry
We added over 100 lines of custom Delphi Pascal code (below) to RInno installers that queries the registry and customizes installations on each machine. The helper functions determine if R and/or Pandoc are needed and modify the post installation step of Inno Setup to write a JSON file in each app's utils folder called "regpaths.json" (the old-school programmer in you should appreciate seeing JSON created by Delphi Pascal, which predates JSON by a few decades). This file is accessed throught the start up sequence to ensure that dependencies are where we think they are.

There has been a decent amount of interest in using shared machines to install shiny apps using RInno. A few people have tested this new methodology on shared machines and found it worked out of the box, so that is a promising sign if you are interested in doing something similar at your organization.

## Final Thoughts
Besides improving the authentication of continuous installations, we are thinking about ways to use `packrat` to isolate RInno-installed apps from the user's R package library. This and other ideas are still in their nascent stages, but I am very excited to have Hanjo on the team. If you are thinking you're not qualified, that is simply false. I was a political science major who minored in economics and women and gender studies. I spent the first half of my career working in the non-profit industry doing project management and social work... I don't speak the lingo of a computer scientist and only started programming in 2013. The more the merrier!
